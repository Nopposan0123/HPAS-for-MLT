1) The floor was dry and clear of any obstacles. There was adequate lighting and ambient temperature  in the warehouse. During a dual lift operation, victim and helper were attempting to lift 60kg drum from the warehouse floor into the freezer doorway.                                                                                      
2) Helper was facing the freezer and victim had his back to the freezer. Victim was positioned with his feet on the warehouse floor immediately in front of the steps of the freezer doorway. The process to lift the drum required victim to standing on the step of the freezer doorway.                                                                                                                                                3) Victim raised his foot to step backwards and place it on the step behind him.                                                                                                                            4) Victim's foot was caught between the step and drum so did not move with upper body and he lost balance.
5) Victim visited local accident and emergency department and was examined by medical practitioner. Victim was advised to rest his foot for a “few days”.  No medication or treatment was administered or recommended.
