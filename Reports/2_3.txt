・Two workers started cleaning the cooling tower.
・One worker (hereafter referred to as worker A, team leader) climbs up to the cooling tower work floor (1.9m), removes the cooling tower air intake fins, and another worker(Hereafter referred to as worker B and victim), worker B cleaned the fins on the ground.
・At around 11:00, Worker A asked Worker B to fetch a tool (spanner) from the tool storage area of ML2 because there was a fin that was difficult to remove. Worker B fetches a tool and I tried to give it to Worker A.
・At that time, Worker B caught his leg on the protrusion of the fixing part of the cable rack at his feet and leaned forward, and his left leg muscle seemed to be stretched.He had no falls or other bruises.
・After that, Worker B continued to work (cleaning the fins, most of which was done while sitting down), but reported to Worker A that he had pain in his left leg when he stood up and moved.He decided that he would go home that day and see how things went. At 16:00, Worker A contacted the section chief to that effect.
