Around 9:15ã€€ After the morning meeting, the victim  together with another filling operator were preparing for Takenate I-3000 filling .Since the container size changed from 18L to 3L, they had to adjust the height of nozzle.
Around 9:30  Line purging with N2 and previous product flushing were done. The victim and his buddy were adjusting the height of nozzle to meet the 3L can's height. Previously, the height was set for 18L can's height. The weighing nett weight was set as 2.6 kg beforehand by somebody else (The system was safe-designed in the way that it will start filling only if the start button is pressed and the correct weight container is placed on the weighing platform). At the moment, I-3000 feeding pump was running and the filling machine upstream manual valve was already opened. It was a situation where, if start button is pressed, the product might spill out. The victim has once took off his goggles so that it would be easy for him to monitor the height of the nozzle.
Around 10:00   Another operator put the 3L can on the platform as he found out leakage under the nozzle. As the result, the nozzle suddenly opened and the product spilled onto the can top, and splashed onto the victim face. (Later it was informed that before that, the start button was half-stucked, and possible that in ON condition). The product got into the victim left eye. Soon, he was assisted by his buddy to the nearest shower, and he washed his face and eyes with plenty of water. However, later on he felt the pain on his eye.
Around 10:15   The office staff has brought him to the hospital for treatment. His left eye was checked and cleaned by the medical staff. He suffered eye inflammation and received an eye ointment as a medicine. The inflammation gone on the next day.
