At about 1345 hrs, the injured person was assigned task to perform nitrogen purging from Low Boiler (LB) impurity feed pump GA-824 to Phenol Plant. During the process of purging, the injured person checked the pressure gauge and found the reading was 'zero'. Immediately he was given instruction to stop purging and depressurize the system. He isolated the discharge line valve followed by the nitrogen isolation valve before opening the nitrogen depressurizing valve. He found nothing came out from the depressurizing point and he proceeded to remove the flexible hose. Once he removed the flexible hose, the trapped LB in the flexible hose came into contact onto his neck and few drops on his arms. 

It was found that injured person performed a wrong line-up by not opening the additional valve at PG line. He mis-interpret that the flexible hose has already been de-pressurized because the pressure gauge reading was zero.
