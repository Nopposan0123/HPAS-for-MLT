At approximately 5:30am an Employee was splashed with recovered Isocyanate while attempting to verify a line was clear from HP385 to HT391. Employees found earlier in the evening that the recovered ISO was not pumping through HP385 thus having to stop production. A safe work and line break and Lock out was completed and the employees had drained what they thought was all the material out of the line at the lowest point.  After completing the drain of the line, the employees attempted to use low pressure N2 to purge through from the top of HT391 feed line down through the pump to the drain port and was unsuccessful, they could not blow N2 through.  The employees then attempted to use high pressure N2 from the bottom up to top and this is when the material blew out of the disconnected line on top of HT391 and splashed the employee helping. The employee immediately rinsed off and showered for 10 minutes and at approximately 5:50am was taken to the hospital for evaluation. The employee was subsequently scheduled the same day to see the Company OccMed Doctor and told to report to work the next day. A follow up appointment with OccMed was on scheduled for 8/25/16. The employee was told at the follow up appointment to stay off work for two days (8/24 & 8/26).
