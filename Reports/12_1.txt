2:30 In order to sample the collected PDI from the collected NCO line at 3:00, the opening and closing operation was performed incorrectly to check if valve A was stuck (At this time, the sampling port was closed with a cam lock cap, and the collected NCO There was an internal pressure of about 0.2 MPa in the line.)
2:50 Attempted to open cam lock B with valve A closed, but it was stuck, so the operation to remove upper cam lock A began. When the cam lock was loosened and tried to be removed, the collected PDI blew out from the gap and was exposed to liquid (about 100 cc from the valve to the cam lock) and contacted the team leader. The group leader instructs them to wash their face, eyes, and gargle. Wash your eyes after washing your face and gargling
After 40 minutes, take a break in the rest room (I felt a sore throat, a tingling sensation on my face, and a little eye discharge).
6:00: The sore throat and tingling sensation on the face have subsided, but the eye discharge continues.
7:10 Report when the section manager/department manager arrives. The director instructed me to have a medical examination.
8:50 Visit an ophthalmologist/dermatologist
He was wearing flat glasses when he removed the cam lock, but he did so without wearing goggles. (It becomes the standard to wear)
