1. When the victim goes to pick up the next cut semi-finished product from the OP4 slitter to the No.11 frame, the OP transport table lifter is operated with the right hand to operate the travel lever switch, and while the table lifter is running, the patrol light informs that the air stopper of the No.7 frame will be lowered. Notice that is lit.
2. The victim released his right hand from the travel lever switch that was being operated at the No. 7 pedestal and moved the air stopper operation lever installed next to the pedestal to raise the air stopper without confirming that the table lifter had stopped. When I put it out, I was caught between the trestle and the table lifter operation protection fence.
