In order to transfer work from the Research & Development Div. to the Production Div., under the supervision of the Research & Development Div., the workers were conducting column separation of media pigment.
Measures to prevent static electricity such as spraying water on the ground, installing grounding wire, and aerating nitrogen were conducted before filling the column. (Dispersing silica gel in toluene)
When filling the second column, colored residual liquid burst out of the nitrogen pipe (assumed to have gotten mixed in during the previous work). To prevent contamination, the workers stopped the nitrogen flow and continued the work.
