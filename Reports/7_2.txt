(15:20) In order to insert the semi-finished product card into the semi-finished product in the 1-1 cradle, I got on the table lifter and pressed the switch to move to the 1-1 cradle on the operation panel, but I accidentally moved to the 1-5 cradle. The table lifter moved to the 1-5 stand side (opposite side) because the switch to go was pressed. When I turned my body over to check the direction of travel while the lifter was still operating, I realized that I had made a mistake, and my right foot protruded from the step platform. of safety shoes were caught.I immediately tried to stop the table lifter by pressing the emergency stop button, but I was unable to stop the table lifter due to my poor posture, and my ankle was caught after the safety shoes were caught. After the table lifter driver's seat passed over the support and his leg came off, he pressed the emergency button on the table lifter to stop it.
(15:40) When I checked his ankle, it was so swollen that I cooled his ankle with cold spray and icing.
(16:15) He was transported to Toyooka-cho Tanaka Orthopedic Surgery by company car. However, his ankle was so swollen that it was difficult for him to walk.
When I reexamined with MRI the next day, it turned out that there was a crack in the back of the bone.
