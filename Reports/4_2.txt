Employee was attempting to filter a product MP2615 UV (coating) with a syringe and filter - approximately 15 mil. While applying pressure to the syringe the filter at the bottom came off and the material squirted out on the lab counter and back into the face of the employee. The employee was wearing the required PPE at the time of the incident. After the splash, the employee was immediately helped by another lab employee to the eye wash where water was run for 15 minutes over his face and eyes. Subsequently, the QC manager took the employee to the medical clinic near the lab where the employee was evaluated by a physician (the SDS for the coating was provided to the clinic).
