(1) Coating work was completed, and blade unit cleaning work was started.
(2) The victim wore cut prevention gloves + poly gloves on his right hand and poly gloves on his left hand for cleaning. Holding a waste cloth in his right hand and a holding plate in his left hand, he began cleaning.
(3) Because the dirt was so bad, when I tried to rub the cloth with my right hand, the holding plate moved along with the movement of my right hand, causing a cut at the base of my left thumb.
* KY was conducted before coat work.
* Although there is a blade assembly procedure manual, there was no cleaning procedure manual.
