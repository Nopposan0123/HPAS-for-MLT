10:25ã€€The victim started weighing the cresol from the drum into the weighing container with a manual pump in preparation for charging the reaction kettle. (Planned amount to be weighed: 9.6 kg) I rotated the pump several times while watching the tip of the flexible hose to prevent the liquid from splashing out of the container. (Fig. 1) When I checked my left arm, I found that the work clothes between my shoulder and my wrist were wet with cresol that had leaked out due to a flexible hose crack*. (The flexible hose has been used for 10 years. It has been confirmed that the hose has never leaked. Based on the results of the leak test, the amount of liquid received is estimated to be several milliliters.) The victim immediately stopped working and took off his work clothes. .
*Cracks in the hose cannot be visually confirmed, but a leak test confirms leakage near the connection on the drum side of the flexible hose (Fig. 2 on the right).
