The dispensing machine was setup by Operator 1 with the assistance of Operator 2. While configuring the machine to dispense with PM glycol ether, the dispensing nozzle hose burst, spraying Operator 2 in the safety glasses. The rupture was enough to knock off the glasses and get into the eyes of Operator 2. Operator 1 immediately shut the air feed to the pump off and walked Operator 2 to the eye wash station. Operator 2 proceeded to rinse out their eyes with water for approximately 10 minutes. Safety officer was notified of the incident and took pictures of the incident. Safety officer proceeded to take Operator 2 to the clinic for a checkup. End result was no chemical residue in the eyes of Operator 2 and a Doctor's note to take the rest of the day off. The Doctor also provided eye drops, an eye patch (if necessary) and prescription strength ibuprofen. A follow up appointment was made for 10:30 am the following day.  No further restrictions.
